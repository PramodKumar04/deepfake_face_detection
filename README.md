# Deepfake Face Detection System

## Overview

The **Deepfake Face Detection System** is a machine learning–based application designed to detect manipulated or synthetic facial images generated through deepfake techniques. The system analyzes uploaded images and determines whether they are **real or deepfake** using a trained deep learning model.

With the rapid advancement of AI-generated media, deepfakes pose serious risks including misinformation, identity fraud, and digital manipulation. This project aims to provide a practical solution for identifying such manipulated media.

The model achieves an **accuracy of approximately 80%** with an **AUC (Area Under Curve) score of 0.8843**, indicating strong capability in distinguishing between real and fake images.

# Key Features

* Detects whether a face image is **Real or Deepfake**
* Deep learning–based classification
* Backend inference API for predictions
* Simple frontend interface for uploading images
* Modular architecture for model loading and inference
* Supports extension for video deepfake detection

# Model Performance

| Metric    | Score                     |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| Accuracy  | ~80%                      |
| AUC Score | 0.8843                    |
| Precision | High for fake detection   |
| Recall    | Good detection capability |

### Interpretation

* **Accuracy (80%)** indicates that the model correctly classifies 8 out of 10 images.
* **AUC = 0.8843** shows strong discriminative performance, meaning the model effectively separates real and fake samples across different thresholds.

# System Architecture

The project is divided into **Backend** and **Frontend** components.

```
User Upload → Frontend Interface → Backend API → Model Inference → Prediction Result
```

### Workflow

1. User uploads an image through the frontend.
2. The image is sent to the backend API.
3. The backend processes the image and loads the trained model.
4. The model performs inference.
5. The prediction (Real / Fake) is returned to the user.

# Backend Explanation

The backend handles **model loading, inference, and API communication**.

### main.py

Acts as the **entry point of the backend server**.
It initializes the API service and handles incoming requests from the frontend.

Responsibilities:

* Start backend server
* Accept image uploads
* Trigger inference pipeline

---

### inference.py

Handles the **deep learning prediction process**.

Responsibilities:

* Image preprocessing
* Face detection (if implemented)
* Running the model on input images
* Returning prediction probabilities

---

### model_loader.py

Loads the trained deep learning model.

Responsibilities:

* Load model weights
* Initialize neural network architecture
* Prepare the model for inference

This avoids reloading the model for every prediction, improving performance.

---

### api_wrapper.py

Wraps backend functionality into **API endpoints**.

Responsibilities:

* Receive image requests
* Call inference functions
* Send prediction results back to the frontend

---

### check_weights.py

Utility script to verify whether the model weights are available and properly loaded.

This prevents runtime errors caused by missing model files.

---

### test_load.py

Testing utility used to verify that the model loads correctly before running the full application.

---

### uploads Folder

Stores images temporarily uploaded by users for prediction.

---

# Frontend Explanation

The frontend provides a simple user interface.

### index.html

Main webpage where users can:

* Upload images
* Submit files for analysis
* View detection results

---

### style.css

Handles visual styling including:

* Layout
* Buttons
* Upload interface
* Result display

---

# Technology Stack

### Machine Learning

* Python
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* OpenCV

### Backend

* Python API server

### Frontend

* HTML
* CSS
